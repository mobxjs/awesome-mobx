<!-- Thanks for suggesting we add / remove projects to the list! :)
     In the past we've kept this pretty loose, but we now ask that you follow these guidelines:

     (Check with an 'x' inside them to denote that you've completed the requested task) -->

## Requirements for PRs

- [ ] I have made sure the project / library is at least **5 months old** (Not applicable to blogs, videos, tutorials etc)
- [ ] I have **linked to GitHub** or other source control sites and **not** package sites such as **npm** or yarn
- [ ] I have submitted translations where appropriate
  - If you are not comfortable translating, please comment on the PR requesting a translation.
- [ ] I have not included profanity anywhere in the file

<!-- Feel free to tag relevant users here, i.e., maybe hawkins if you have questions, or politely tag SangKa if you need translations -->
